The R Script "Seifus code" is an exploratory analysis that also includes the predictive model. All one 
needs to do to operate this code is import the dataset "Cyber Security Breaches" found here http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html.

The "Data Breach Visualizations" R script provides the analyst with more context regarding how many breaches there 
are per year. 

Good Luck!

The goal of this report is to shed light on the importance of cyber 
security while attempting to predict on potential future attacks by highlighting 
some of the most vulnerable industries and personal devices to cyber-attacks. 
The problem being addressed is that since 2013 over 3.5 million records have been 
stolen every single day. Additionally, there are more than 80-90 million cyber-security 
events per year, and about 400 new attacks every minute, while about 70% of the attacks go undetected. 
The cost of which is approximately $12.7 million on average that a company might spend, and $575 billion 
annual global economies cost on cybercrime. Moreover, about $3 trillion of the global economy is being 
at risk of the cyber-attack by 2020. Therefore, it is essential that a means of prediction and overall 
better protection become available against these attacks. A predictive model was deployed on historical 
data to discover which industries and devices were most vulnerable to attacks. It can be concluded that 
certain industries and types of companies are more vulnerable than others as a target to cyber attackers 
with the intent to steal their information. However, these conclusions do not come without drawbacks in 
their accuracy.
